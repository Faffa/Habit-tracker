# Persona: Alex "The Strategist" Johnson

## 1. Background
- **Age:** 48
- **Profession:** Software Engineering Manager at a mid-sized tech company.
- **Family:** Married, two teenage children.
- **Health Literacy:** High. Listens to health podcasts (Huberman, Attia) and has read "Outlive". Understands concepts like Zone 2, VO2 Max, and metabolic health.

## 2. Goals & Motivations
- **Primary Goal:** To be physically and cognitively robust in his 80s and 90s. He wants to be able to hike, play with his future grandchildren, and maintain mental clarity. He sees "healthspan" as his most important personal KPI.
- **Secondary Goal:** To use data to optimize his efforts. As an engineer, he believes "what gets measured, gets managed." He wants to see trends and ensure his weekly efforts align with his long-term goals.
- **Motivation:** Inspired by the proactive, evidence-based framework of Medicine 3.0. He is motivated by progress and the feeling of being in control of his long-term health trajectory.

## 3. Frustrations & Pain Points
- **Tracking Fragmentation:** He currently uses a mix of apps and notes to track his activities. His workout app logs minutes, a separate note tracks his weekly Zone 2 goal, and he "just tries to remember" if he hit his protein target. It feels disorganized.
- **Lack of a "Longevity Dashboard":** He wants a single source of truth specifically for his "Outlive" protocol. General fitness apps are too broad and don't focus on the specific metrics he cares about.
- **Injury Setbacks:** In the past, he has pushed too hard on lifting or running, leading to minor injuries that derailed his routine for weeks. He now appreciates the book's emphasis on stability as a foundational, non-negotiable practice.

## 4. Technical Savviness
- **High:** Very comfortable with web applications and mobile apps.
- **Hardware:** Owns a chest-strap heart rate monitor and a smartwatch (e.g., Xiaomi Smart Band, Garmin, or Apple Watch) and is willing to use them to get accurate data. Intrigued by the idea of using Web Bluetooth to connect his devices directly to a web app.

## 5. How Alex will use "Outlive Tracker"
He will use the app daily to log his metrics. At the end of the week, he will review his Zone 2 progress bar to see if he hit the >180-minute target. He wants to look at the historical table to see his "star rating" and feel a sense of accomplishment for consistent days. The "Connect Watch" feature is highly appealing as it would streamline his Zone 2 tracking.
